# Cryptocurrencies

## Background

In this project, I created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment. The data was cprocessed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output, I used unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, I chose a clustering algorithm. Finally, I used data visualizations to share findings.
